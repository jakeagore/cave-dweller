# 🧭 Cave Dweller - First Person Puzzle Game

## 🎮 Project Overview
**Cave Dweller** is a first-person puzzle adventure developed for a **Computer Graphics class project**. You play as a daring explorer trapped inside an ancient cave system. To escape, you must solve environmental puzzles and photograph hidden relics. But beware — as you delve deeper, your sanity is constantly at risk. Document every relic and maintain your composure long enough to find your way back to the surface.

---

## 🏆 Objective
- Solve environmental puzzles to unlock access to ancient relics.
- Photograph all three relics hidden within the cave.
- Escape the cave before your sanity runs out.

## 🗺️ Gameplay Features
- 🧩 **Three Unique Puzzles and Relics**:
  1. **Ancient Mask** – Solve the **weighing idols puzzle** using a UV light to reveal the correct idols to remove.
  2. **Sacrificial Knife** – Guide a ball through a **maze** to unlock the relic.
  3. **Sacred Text** – Rearrange sticks to form a **star shape**.
